        <h1>The Postive Grid Pro Series Compressor</h1>
        <div id="pgc-content">
            <p> First of all, although I have never used another product from Positive Grid before, and I have barely even heard of them, it must be said that these guys are doing something right.  Perhaps better known for manufacturing physical guitar amp heads and pedals, as well as guitar amp/pedal modelling plug-ins, the know-how to take what they did with various tube, transistor, and transformer modelling technology has been well honed to make a dedicated set of compressor models such as this!</p>

            <p> It comes in the form of three fairly loose and flexible emulations based on iconic compressors of old, all with different fundamental types of gain detectors and components modelled:  The all-tube Fairchild 660, Teletronix LA-2A Optical, and FET base Urei 1176.</p>

            <p> This is all well trodden territory in itself.  I have countless different versions of emulations of all of these plug-ins respectively.  What's new here is the focus on tweakability, right down to the component level.  Wanna swap out the tubes on the 670 emulation?  You got it.  Change the tube bias and the tranformer emulation on the input and/or the output stage?  Check!  You can change the optical detector element on the LA-2A emulation, and plus actually have control over the attack and release, which are normally fixed parameters on an LA-2A of course.  In practice, this all actually can sound <span id="emphasize">GREAT!</span></p>

            <p> Switching up the transformers on the Fairchild, changing the tubes and rebiasing fast turns the iconic, very well known equipment into a unique instrument of destruction!  I could practically dial in all on the sonics want on a drum bus by just messing with those elements alone and then setting appropiate threshold and gain settings.  You can even get pretty close to emulating other compressors and compressor types altogether if you play around.  I got a great dBX 160 VCA compressor sound out of the 1176 model just tweaking some of the parameters in there!</p>

            <p> In short:  Check it out!  But, be prepared to buy it.  It is just too good, and I am calling it my new secret weapon for character compression these days!</p>
